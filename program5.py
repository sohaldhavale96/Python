cgpa = 8.40
cgpa *= 10

# Division assignment
num = 100
num /= 10
print(f"New value of num after dividing it by 10 : {num}")

# Floor Division assignment
number = 5
number//=2
print(f"Floor division of 5//2 : {number}")

# Exponentiation assignment
num = 2
num **= 2
print(f"Square of 2 is {num}")

# Modulo assignement
number = 5
number %= 2
print(f"Reminder after dividing 5 by 2 : {number}")
